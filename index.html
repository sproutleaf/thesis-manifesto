                    On Making a Thesis of My Own
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div class="m">
                        <p><span>“If not me, then who?”</span> Have faith in my unique perspective and channel it
                            into my
                            project: it’s the best (and sometimes,
                            the only) way for it to be alive and compelling. There are at least a dozen other people who
                            can
                            code an intricate program or make a generative game, but I should be the only one—with my
                            unique
                            experiences, whims, and obsessions—who can bring my thesis to life.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="m">
                        <p><span>Thesis is for better self-articulation, not employability.</span> I respect people who
                            know
                            what they want, and envision thesis as a future portfolio piece catered
                            to the eyes of potential employers, but that’s not me. It’s an unprecedented luxury to be
                            able
                            to dedicate a whole year to something I’m passionate about. It’s even more precious to have
                            absolute creative freedom, unadulterated by capitalistic demands or pressures. To me, it
                            seems
                            awfully wasteful to not use this opportunity to find clarity on what is and how I want to
                            sustain my creative practice. Better self-articulation will always remain my strongest
                            motivation behind making my thesis.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="m">
                        <p><span>Resist temptation.</span> It’s normal to feel a healthy amount of envy towards other
                            people’s
                            projects, even my own
                            unrealized ideas. Despite the appeal of starting from scratch or stretching myself in a
                            million
                            directions, I need to be honest with myself: I have neither the capacity nor the talent to
                            hesitate, meander, or begin again. Marry to an idea early, water it, watch it grow—it might
                            become more than what I’ve ever dreamed of.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="m">
                        <p><span>Be consistent.</span> A year is definitely a substantial amount of time for a project.
                            However, it’s also
                            easy to keep indulging in the illusion that “I still have so much time left”, until that’s
                            not true anymore. How many people do I know who rushed their thesis in the last three
                            months? Making a thesis is indeed a time-based endeavor; a journey that should be navigated
                            steadily. A rule of thumb: spending half an hour every day on research, tinkering, mulling
                            over ideas is always better than cramming a prototype in one week.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="m">
                        <p><span>Have fun!</span> Growing pains, challenging obstacles… sure. Suffering, mental agony? I
                            have outgrown them. Making a thesis should be a mostly fulfilling and fun experience, and if
                            that’s not true, I need to either lighten up or make perceptive changes.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    On Making a Thesis with People I Love
                </div>

                                Towards resource-sharing & against gatekeeping.</span> Many of us are amateurs when it
                            comes to building a creative practice, while even more of us carry ambitions of having our
                            work recognized and celebrated, ideally outside of school too. A good strategy to bridge
                            this gap is resource-sharing. Stumbled upon an artwork that reminded me of someone? I’ll
                            forward it to them. Read an essay that can help someone lay a stronger theoretical
                            foundation? I’ll share it with them. Encountered an opportunity that can help someone secure
                            more funds or resources? I’ll encourage them to apply. We form an ecosystem and start to
                            thrive when we care for each other and each other’s work with love and generosity—and that’s
                            how we create amazing thesis projects: beyond individually, as a community.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="m">
                        <p><span>Be each other’s expert and teacher.</span> We come from diverse backgrounds, often
                            already specialists in the fields we worked in. A sophisticated thesis project, on the other
                            hand, is most often expansive and relies on knowledge and proficiency beyond our own.
                            Trading expertise can be a sweet and generative way of growing our projects together, while
                            understanding each other more as individuals and artists.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="m">
                        <p><span>Celebrate milestones together.</span> The end of thesis week should not be the only
                            occasion for relaxation and conviviality; smaller steps—commitment to an idea, first
                            prototype, alumni critiques…—deserve attention and joy too. Celebrate milestones together
                            and often, be open enough to let these moments carry us forward.</p>

                        <p><span>Strive for care and maintenance.</span> I still daydream about my Chinese blog or game
                            logs from the 2000s sometimes, wondering how or when they vanished into the shadows of the
                            Internet’s past, yearning for their nostalgic power as time capsules. Websites decay and
                            become abandoned; programs outgrow technology stacks they were built on; hardware breaks and
                            ages… It’s nearly impossible to preserve a technology-based project forever, but for as long
                            as maintenance is viable, I will tend to my thesis and mend the cracks: a renewal of spirit
                            and possibilities.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="m">
                        <p><span>Let my thesis be witnessed, remembered, shared.</span> On the Internet, in other
                            people’s minds, in archives… My thesis can live in many different environments, and can
                            certainly outlive the period designated for thesis development, or even its own lifespan. I
                            will document and share my work. Share on as many platforms as possible. Wait for people to
                            experience, feel, and find resonance. Olia Lialina’s personal website, with its glittery
                            ambience and handmade aesthetics reminiscent of the web 1.0 era, is still being visited and
                            admired by young people and seasoned surfers alike. My thesis can inspire people decades
                            down the road too, and that’s perhaps the most special and meaningful approach towards
                            longevity.</p>
